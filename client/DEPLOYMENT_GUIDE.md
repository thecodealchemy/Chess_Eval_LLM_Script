# Netlify Deployment Instructions

## Issues Fixed:

1. ✅ Added proper environment variable configuration for API URLs
2. ✅ Created `_redirects` file for React Router support
3. ✅ Added error boundary for better error handling
4. ✅ Added debug logging to identify issues
5. ✅ Created `netlify.toml` for optimal deployment settings
6. ✅ Updated Vite config for production builds

## Deployment Steps:

### 1. Update Environment Variables in Netlify:

Go to your Netlify site settings and add this environment variable:

- Variable: `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
- Value: `https://your-backend-api-url.com/api/v1`

### 2. Build Settings in Netlify:

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`
- Node version: `18`

### 3. Deploy:

1. Connect your repository to Netlify
2. Set the environment variables
3. Deploy

## Current Status:

- ✅ Build works locally
- ✅ Preview works locally (http://localhost:4173/)
- ❓ Backend API URL needs to be configured for production

## Important Notes:

- The app will show error messages if backend is not available
- Console logs will show the API URL being used
- Error boundary will catch React errors and show user-friendly messages

## Backend Requirements:

You need to deploy your backend server and update the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable with the correct URL.

## Troubleshooting:

1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure backend API is accessible from the deployed frontend
4. Check network tab for failed API requests
